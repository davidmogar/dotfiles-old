# dotfiles
Home for my non-sensitive dotfiles.

## How to use it?

If you are using Ubuntu (that's the distro I use) you can simply execute the next commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/davidmogar/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./prerequisites.sh
```

If not the case, just copy the files to the right paths ;)
